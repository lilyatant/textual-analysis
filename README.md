### Analysis of tweets about Facebook/Meta

The dataset comprises 2000 most recent tweets with the hashtag #facebook and #meta. Amongst others it contains these variabes: tweet text, user id, screenname, time of creation, etc

For this project, I will address the following questions:
1. Which words are most commonly used in the dataset?
2. Do we find anything interesting when looking at a word cloud of the data?
3. Does this change if we look at the tf_idf logic?
4. What are the most common sentiments in the tweets?
5. Are the posts about facebook rather positive, or rather negative?
